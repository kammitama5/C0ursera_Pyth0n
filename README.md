# C0ursera_Pyth0n

Taking 4.5 courses:

1. Python Data Structures (Dec - Jan).
2. Intro to Interactive Programming in Python 1 and 2 (Dec - Feb).

   Includes:
   
           1. Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game
           2. Guess the Number Game
           3. Random GUI programmes that draw to canvas and do various tasks (eg. simple calculator)
           
3. Principles of Computing (Jan - Feb).
4. Algorithms 2 (Feb - March).

* Disclaimer: I've done and numbers 1 and 2 in the past (about 1.5 years ago), so 
  it should be more of a refresher (that was some ugly, ugly code
  and I really didn't know what I was doing. Lots of "x"s and "y"s and stuff for naming.
  I don't think I can get away with naming while loops potato anymore.
  They now have a stricter way of checking var names, etc.
  
  It's very interesting actually coming back and having more of a sense of
  what you're doing and understanding, vs hacking things together.
  I think the logic would make more sense now. It's a WIP.

  This will all be in Python, and is supplemented by some code,
  which will be from the pdf "Think like a C0mputer Scientist (in Python).",
  which I've been working through in my spare time.

  I have to squeeze a revision of some C++ concepts in for a Data Structure class (Jan),
  which is in person and for a grade put on a record (that I may care about in the future), 
  but should be OK.

  Will be done over time.
