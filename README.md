Taking three courses:

1. Python Data Structures (Dec - Jan)

3. Algorithms 2 (Feb - March)

This will all be in Python, and is supplemented by some code,
which will be from the pdf "Think like a C0mputer Scientist (in Python)"

This may be supplemented by some Games made in Python (see other repo -> Python Games)
