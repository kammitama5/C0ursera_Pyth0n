# C0ursera_Pyth0n

Taking three courses:

1. Python Data Structures (Dec - Jan)
2. Intro to Interactive Programming in Python (1 and 2) (Dec - Feb)
3. Principles of Computing (Jan - Feb) 
4. Algorithms 2 (Feb - March)

This will all be in Python, and is supplemented by some code,
which will be from the pdf "Think like a C0mputer Scientist (in Python).",
which I've been working through in my spare time.

I have to squeeze a revision of some C++ concepts in for a Data Structure class, but should be OK.

Will be done over time.
