# C0ursera_Pyth0n

Taking 4.5 courses:

1. Python Data Structures (Dec - Jan)
2. Intro to Interactive Programming in Python (1 and 2) (Dec - Feb)
3. Principles of Computing (Jan - Feb) 
4. Algorithms 2 (Feb - March)

* Disclaimer: I've done and 1 and 2 in the past (about 1.5 years ago), so 
  it should be more of a refresher (that was some ugly, ugly code
  and I didn't know what I was doing. Lots of "x"s and "y"s and stuff for naming.
  They now have a stricter way of checking var names, etc.

This will all be in Python, and is supplemented by some code,
which will be from the pdf "Think like a C0mputer Scientist (in Python).",
which I've been working through in my spare time.

I have to squeeze a revision of some C++ concepts in for a Data Structure class, but should be OK.

Will be done over time.
