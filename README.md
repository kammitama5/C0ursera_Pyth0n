# C0ursera_Pyth0n

Taking three courses:

1. Python Data Structures (Dec - Jan)
2. Principles of Computing (Jan - Feb) 
3. Algorithms 2 (Feb - March)

This will all be in Python, and is supplemented by some code,
which will be from the pdf "Think like a C0mputer Scientist (in Python).",
which I've been working through in my spare time.

This may be supplemented by some Games made in Python (see other repo -> Python Games).

Will be done over time.
